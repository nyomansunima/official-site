        As an indie maker, I embrace the entrepreneurial spirit, taking on the
        entire process from ideation to deployment. I relish the freedom to
        explore my creativity and the ability to execute projects with autonomy.
        It allows me to deliver unique and personalized solutions that truly
        reflect my vision as a designer and developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Start from idea, bring into scratch, then brainstorming the actual idea.
        Think more about it, how i can make it better and try to address into a
        problem. Then, I'll try to make it real, and try to make it better.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's can be a digital product, business, services, goodies, saas, and
        even some of them are prototype. Try to make it become a problem solver.
        Give more value, publish and build it publicly. I love to running a
        business and try to make more money from it. However i know that should
        give more value for the user and the customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's make me think again and again, should i or how to?. That the base
        question should i ask before start move into actions. I know everything
        is not that easy. But the motivation and condition make me keep going
        and keep moving.
